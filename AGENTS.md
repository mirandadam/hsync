# Base rules

## Requirements

The file `Specification.md` contains the requirements of the application being developed in this repository.

**Do not change it** unless explicitly requested by the user. And even if explicitly requested, do not add or remove anything _beyond_ what the user requested.

**All code** implemented in the application should be directly traceable to the specification document. This includes application code, tests, tooling, CI behavior.

If you come across something or are requested to implement something that is not in the specification document or contradicts it, stop and ask the user to update the specification. When asking, propose one or more clear and concise alternatives. Only proceed after the specification aligns with the instructions.

## Interpreting instructions

Avoid silently making significant inferences and decisions. If there is a relevant gap in the instructions you received, stop and ask the user for clarification.

## Style

The code should be easily readable and key parts of it should have clear and concise comments.

Keep code size as small as possible while keeping essential comments, maintaining readability and adhering to requirements.

## General instructions

Keep all communication and generated content concise, clear and straightforward. Minimize complexity wherever possible.
